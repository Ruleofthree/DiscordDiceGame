A bot for discord to help automate combat, and the economy for the Role Playing
 game Forsaken Isles. Also used for character creation. 
 
 The bot obtains all its information from various .json files. Including:
 * Experience point chart
 * Feats, their description, and any modifiers/penalties they apply
 * Traits, their description, and any modifiers/penalties they apply
 * Potion Generation
 * Equipment Generation
 * Storage of token needed to log bot on server
 * uniqueIDs of various channels within server
 
 All .json files, with exception to the level chart, should be placed in a folder
 called 'game files'
 
 A folder called 'characters' should also be created, as all character generations are
 stored in a .json file with the players unique discordID.
 
 All .json files are withheld from the github until project is complete, as the bot is
 still undergoing testing to ensure it is ready for public use. Should someone attempt
 to use this bot in the mean time, they are welcome to contact me for assistance in
 creating such .json files.
